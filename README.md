# Personal Website
Hi! This is my responsive personal website where I post the projects that I do and the process behind it.

[Check it out!](https://sujohnson.com/)

## Future update plans
   •  Update more projects in detail<br/>
   •  Fix the badly written React <br/>
   •  Play around with more React funtionality<br/>
   
## Something looks cool?
You may use my repo as a base for your own personal website but please contact me and give proper attribution if you want to use my code as a template!
